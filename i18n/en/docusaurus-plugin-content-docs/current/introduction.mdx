This is a record of the process of building my personal website. I hope this sharing can help those who encounter similar problems or need similar tutorials, and let them take fewer detours, but detours can also make you learn more and gain experience.

I am still learning. I am not very professional in the framework principles involved in this website. My building process can be said to be crossing the river by feeling the stones, but the documents I record are all successfully run by me, and you can rest assured to refer to them (if there is a version change, it may not be applicable)

> If you encounter a different situation from me, or do not achieve the expected effect according to my steps, donâ€™t worry, be patient, and be good at using search engines or GPT. Of course, you can also browse me in the comments below the article. I will reply immediately when I see it.
