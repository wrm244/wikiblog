## 1.1 A Closer Look at the Processor and Primary Storage 

We have learned that all computers have similar capabilities and perform essentially thesame functions, although some might be faster than others. We have also learned that a computer system has input,output,storage,and processing components; that the processor is the "intelligence" of a computer system; and that a single computer system may have several processors. We have discussed how data are represented inside a computer system in electronic states called bits. We are now ready to expose the inner workings of the nucleus of thecomputer system-the processor.

> 我们已经了解到，所有的计算机都有类似的能力，并执行本质上相同的功能，尽管有些可能比其他的快。我们还知道计算机系统有输入、输出、存储和处理组件;处理器是计算机系统的“智能”;一台计算机系统可以有几个处理器。我们已经讨论了数据如何在计算机系统中以电子状态(称为位)表示。现在我们准备揭示计算机系统的核心——处理器的内部工作原理。

The internal operation of a computer is interesting, but there really is no mystery to it. The mystery is in the minds of those who listen to hearsay and believe science-fiction writer The computer is a nonthinking electronic device that has to be **plugged** into an electrical powersource, just like a toaster or a lamp.

Literally hundreds of different types of computers are marketed by **scores of** manufacturers The complexity of each type may vary considerably, but in the end each processor, sometimes called the central processing unit or CPU,  has only two fundamental sections :the control unitand the arithmetic and logic unit. Primary storage also plays an integral part in the internal operation of a processor. These three-primary storage, the control unit, and the arithmeticand logic unit-work together. Let's look at their functions and the relationships between them.
> 毫不夸张得讲，数以百计的不同类型的计算机被几十家制造商销售。每种类型的复杂性可能相差很大，但最终每个处理器(有时称为中央处理单元或CPU)只有两个基本部分:控制单元和算术与逻辑单元。主存储器在处理器的内部系统中也起着不可或缺的作用。这三个主存储器、控制单元、算术和逻辑单元一起工作。让我们看看它们的功能和它们之间的关系。

Primary storage, or main memory, provides the processor with temporary storage for programs and data. All programs and data must be transferred to primary storage from an input device (such as a VDT ) or from secondary storage (such as a disk ) before programs can be executed or data can be processed. Primary storage space is always at a premium ;therefore, after a program has been executed, the storage space it occupied is reallocated to another program awaiting execution.
>主存储器或内存为处理器提供程序和数据的临时存储器。在执行程序或处理数据之前，必须将所有程序和数据从输入设备(如VDT)或从辅助存储器(如磁盘)传输到主存储器。主存储空间总是很宝贵的;因此，在程序执行结束之后，它所占用的存储空间被重新分配给等待执行的另一个程序。

Figure 1-1 illustrates how all input/output(I/O) is "read to" or "written from" primarystorage. In the figure,an inquiry (input) is made on a VDT. The inquiry,in the form of a message,is routed to primary storage over a channel (such as a coarial cable). Themessage isinterpreted,and the processor initiates action to retrieve the appropriate program and datafrom secondary storage, The program and data are "loaded", or moved,to primary storagefrom secondary storage. This is a nondestructive read process. That is,the program and datathat are read reside in both primary storage (temporarily) and secondary storage(permanently).The data are manipulated according to program instructions, and a report iswritten from primary storage to a printer.

A program instruction or a piece of data is stored in a specific primary storage locationcalled an address. Addresses permit program instructions and data to be located,accessed,andprocessed. The content of each address is constantly changing as different programs areexecuted and new data are processed. Another name for primary storage is random-access memory,or RAM. A special type ofprimary storage, called read-only memory (ROM),cannot be altered by the programmer. Thecontents of ROM are "hard wired" (designed into the logic of the memory chip) by themanufacturer and can be "read only". When you turn on a microcomputer system,a programin ROM automatically readies the computer system for use. Then the ROM program producesthe initial display screen prompt.

A variation of ROM is programmable read-only memory (PROM). PROM is ROM intowhich you,the user,can load "read-only" programs and data. Once a program is loaded toPROM,it is seldom,if ever,changed. However,if you need to be able to revise the contentsof PROM, there is EPROM,erasable PROM. Before a write operation,all the storage cellsmust be erased to the same initial state. 

A more attractive form of read-mostly memory is electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). It can be written into at any time withouit erasing prior contents;only the byte or bytes addressed are updated.

The EEPROM combines the advantage of nonvolatility with the flexibility of beingupdatable in place, using ordinary bus control, address, and data lines. 

Another form of semiconductor memory is flash memory (so named because of thespeed). Flash memory is intermediate between EPROM and EEPROM in both cost andfunctionality.Like EEPROM, flash memory uses an electrical erasing technology. An entireflash memory can be erased in one or a few seconds, which is much faster than EPROM. Inaddition, it is possible to erase just blocks of memory rather than an entire chip.However,flash memory does not provide byte-level erasure. Like EPROM,flash memory uses onlyone transistor per bit, and so achieves the high density of EPROM. 

### Cache Memory 

Program and data are loaded to RAM from secondary storage because the time required toaccess a program instruction or piece of data from RAM is significantly less than fromsecondary storage. Thousands of instructions or pieces of data can be accessed from RAM inthe time it would take to access a single piece of data from disk storage. RAM is essentiallya high-speed holding area for data and programs. In fact,nothing really happens in a computersystem until the program instructions and data are moved to the processor. This transfer ofinstructions and data to the processor can be time-consuming,even at microsecond speeds. To facilitate an even faster transfer of instructions and data to the processor,most computers aredesigned with cache memory. Cache memory is employed by computer designers to increase thecomputer system throughput (the rate at which work is performed). 

Like RAM,cache is a high-speed holding area for program instructions and data.However,cache memory uses SRAM (Static RAM) technology that is about 10 times fasterthan RAM and about 100 times more expensive. With only a fraction of the capacity of RAM,cache memory holds only those instructions and data that are likely to be needed next by theprocessor. Two types of cache memory appear widely in computers. The first is re ferred to asinternal cache and is built into the CPU chip. The second,external cache, is located on chipsplaced close to the CPU chip. A computer can have several different levels of cache memory.Level 1 cache is virtually always built into the chip. Level 2 cache used to be external cachebut is now typically also built into the CPU like level 1 cache.
